Examples of triggers

\subsection{Performance Trigger Example}
Kripke~\cite{kunen2015kripke} is a physics proxy-application for ARDRA, a code at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.
%
Kripke is included with Ascent and implements a parallel sweep solver to solve the equations for deterministic neutron transport.
%
Each sweep consists of wavefronts for each quadrature direction that propagate through the MPI tasks.
%
The Ascent integration captures sweep solver performance metrics, including the maximum backlog of incoming requests from different quadrature directions.
%

In order to show an overall view of the maximum backlog for each MPI task, we created a performance trigger on the maximum back that fires when the maximum backlog exceeds 4 unanswered requests.
%
Using a volume plot shown in figure~\ref{max_backlog}, MPI tasks with higher backlogs appear more opaque than tasks with lower backlogs.
%
Using performance visualization techniques can both highlight performance bottlenecks and provide useful visual debugging information for simulation developers.
