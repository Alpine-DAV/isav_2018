\section{Trigger Examples}
\fix{Do these examples have to be real or just potential use cases? I feel like compelling use cases could be more impactful.}
This section consists of examples and use cases that people MUST have and that are extremely useful. 
%
People can't live without triggers.

\subsection{Field Trigger Example}

Potential examples: Max value greater than x. Entropy greater than Y. 

Actions: save mesh to disk or same some isosurface to disk.

\subsection{Stateful Field Trigger Example}
A simple example of a stateful trigger is a trigger based on entropy.
%
The entropy trigger calculates the distributed-memory histogram of a field on the data set, and using the values of the histogram, calculates entropy using the formula:
\begin{equation}
H(X) = -\sum\limits_{i=1}^n P(x_{i}) log_{2}P(x_{i})
\end{equation}
where $x_{i}$ is the value of histogram bin.
%
Entropy is calculated at every cycle and stored into the state of the trigger.
%
Whenever entropy differs from the previous cycle by a user defined threshold (e.g., 20.0\%), the trigger fires, executing the trigger actions.

Figure~\ref{clover_entropy} plots the entropy value of energy over 200 cycles during a run of Cloverleaf3D, a hydrodynamics proxy-application included with Ascent.
%
\fix{Initially, entropy values vary significantly and ...}

\subsection{Mesh Trigger Example}
Some example of total domain volume using Lulush?

\subsection{Performance Trigger Example}
Kripke~\cite{kunen2015kripke} is a physics proxy-application for ARDRA, a code at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.
%
Kripke is included with Ascent and implements a parallel sweep solver to solve the equations for deterministic neutron transport.
%
Each sweep consists of wavefronts for each quadrature direction that propagate through the MPI tasks.
%
The Ascent integration captures sweep solver performance metrics, including the maximum backlog of incoming requests from different quadrature directions.
%

In order to show an overall view of the maximum backlog for each MPI task, we created a performance trigger on the maximum back that fires when the maximum backlog exceeds 4 unanswered requests.
%
Using a volume plot shown in figure~\ref{max_backlog}, MPI tasks with higher backlogs appear more opaque than tasks with lower backlogs.
%
Using performance visualization techniques can both highlight performance bottlenecks and provide useful visual debugging information for simulation developers.
